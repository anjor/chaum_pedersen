# ZKP Auth protocol

A proof of concept application implementing the Chaumâ€“Pedersen Protocol as an authentication service.

See [Cryptography: An Introduction (3rd Edition) Nigel Smart](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~waa/414-F11/IntroToCrypto.pdf) for more details about the protocol.

## Implementation

The protocol is implemented as simple server and client applications. The server functions as the "Verifier", whereas the client functions as the "Prover".
The main implementation code is in the [zkp_auth](./zkp_auth) directory. Simple wrappers are also provided in the [server](./server) and [client](./client) directories.

The protobuf is included in [auth.proto](./auth.proto).

### Server

In order to start the server simply run 

```
go run ./server/server.go
```

This stands up a server listening on port `50051` providing three RPC methods defined in the protobuf, namely - `Register`, `CreateAuthenticationChallenge` and `VerifyAuthentication`.

### Client

The [client](./zkp_auth/client.go) provides two simple functions `Register` and `Login` making it easy to integrate into any client-side code as demonstrated in the [wrapper code](./client/client.go)
